Creating a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves setting up the basic structure in HTML with elements such as display screens and buttons, styling the layout using CSS for an attractive appearance, implementing JavaScript functions for arithmetic operations and event handling, incorporating error handling to manage invalid inputs or division by zero, and conducting thorough testing and debugging to ensure the calculator functions reliably and accurately. By following these steps, you can create a fully operational calculator with a user-friendly interface on a web page.
